### Hello

I am a Danish hobbyist developer. My primary project is [Zinix], an open-source operating system.

I primarily do systems development but occasionally I also create [video games] and small utilities such as my [DDNS service]. I also like playing piano and solving Rubik's cubes. My personal best is 31.6 seconds.

For programming languages I mostly do Rust and C. I know the communities are quite "against" eachother, but people who can't accept its a subjective choice are just not good enough at either language so they shouldn't participate in such discussion.

oh, and i use arch btw
