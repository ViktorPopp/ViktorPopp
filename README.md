### Hello

I am a Danish hobbyist developer. My primary project is [Zinix], an open-source operating system.

I primarily do systems development but occasionally I also create [video games] and small utilities such as my [DDNS service]. I also like playing piano and solving Rubik's cubes. My personal best is 31.6 seconds.

For programming languages I mostly use Rust and C, but I also play around with other technologies such as C# and Ruby.
